## **Competencies Displayed**
In this project I showcased my ability to perform basic tasks in SQL such as:

1. extracting data (SELECT, SELECT DISTINCT)
2. filtering data (WHERE, LIMIT)
3. sorting data (ORDER BY, DESC)
4. grouping data (GROUP BY)
5. aggregating data (SUM, MAX, COUNT)

These proved useful in gaining key insights from the dataset.
